# Ways to host

* Application hosting
    * [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - static only<br />
        It makes sense to use GhP when you want to put some online demos for your repository<br />
        See [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)
    * AWS
    * [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)
    * DigitalOcean
    * Vultr
    * Your own VDS
        It does not make sense to use it at all :)
* CDN hosting
    * [imgix &#10084;](https://www.imgix.com/)
    * [filestack](https://www.filestack.com/)
