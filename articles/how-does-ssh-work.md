* [Diffie-Hellman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI) or [Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsXMMT2CqqE&t=) to exchange the session key ([Math version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmM9HA2MQGI))
* Symmetric cipher to do encryption, to make transfer secured
* Hashing to remove man-in-the-middle
