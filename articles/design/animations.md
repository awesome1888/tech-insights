# Animations

* [Nice article](https://blog.prototypr.io/6-animation-guidelines-for-ux-design-74c90eb5e47a) about animations<br />
In short:
    * Don't add animations just because you want animation, you should have reason
    * Use animations to get rid of sharp content switch
    * Try to provide the context of usage UI elements with playing some animation on-render
    * Don't use animations which make contradictions with the existing UI elements (i.e. an arrow points left, and the animation goes from top to bottom)
    * Don't use long animations and those which artificially force users to wait for an addition amount of time in order to make the next interaction
    * Use animation to assure user that they really made an action, to prevent they from thinking "did I really press that button?" 
    * Always analyse the animation and think "Could it become annoying in time?"
    * Use short animated scenes to smooth over negative effect of an occurred error, or a high network lag
    * Play around with easing functions, but always keep in mind it should be appropriate for The Brand
    * Don't force users to watch a movie
    * Animation should not go into the contrast with physical effects that could be seen in real life, it should be natural
    * If you need to entertain a user during some long process work out, make an animation that consists of several short sub-scenes
